	<dt>What is this?</dt>
	<dd><p>Openglad was jointly created on and off since 1993 by <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=forgotten+sages+games'>Forgotten Sages</a>, <a href="http://snowstorm.sf.net">Snowstorm Entertainment</a>, and <a href='http://www.dinomage.com'>Dinomage Games</a>. Forgotten Sages originally developed Gladiator in the early 1990s and opensourced it to Snowstorm Entertainment in the early 2000s, who ported it to Windows, Linux, and MacOS and released it as Openglad. Dinomage Games then picked it up, modernized the source code, and released updated versions (including an Android and, soon, an Ouya port!) in the early 2010s.</p></dd>
